# Box Wrapping Problem (BWP)

This repository contains 3 different approaches to solve the Box Wrapping Problem:
* [Constraint Programming](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/box-wrapping/tree/master/CP)
* Linear Programming
* Satisfiability

This is part of the course project [Combinatorial Problem solving](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~erodri/webpage/cps/cps.html).
The complete specification of the problem (input and output format, exact goals, ..) can be found
[in this pdf file](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/box-wrapping/blob/master/statement.pdf), which could be downloaded
from the course's webpage during the second semester of academic year 2017-2018.

## Constraint programming (CP)

The constraint programming approach consists on implementing a mathematical model using
[Gecode](http://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/reference/index.html) (v. 6.0.0). 

## Linear Programming (LP)

## Satisfiability (SAT)
