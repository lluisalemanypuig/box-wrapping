\section{Benchmarking}
\label{sec:benchmarking}

A quick shortcut for the execution of any solver on all files, describing
an input each, inside a directory can be found in the script ``benchmark.sh''
in the ``scripts/'' directory. Its usage is very simple: each solver is
called with the parameters that should make it behave at its best. Therefore,
we only have to indicate the solver we want to execute, the directory with
all the inputs and where to store the output found for each input. An example
can be found in figure \ref{fig:benchmark-example}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,basicstyle=\centering]
$ ./benchmark.sh --solver=CP -i=../inputs/material -o=../outputs/CP
\end{lstlisting}
\centeredcaption{How to use the benchmarking script to execute the solver for
Constraint Programming on the inputs in the \textit{inputs/material} directory.}
\label{fig:benchmark-example}
\end{figure}

The other solvers available are $LP$. This script will, for every input in the
directory, invoke the specified solver and check the quality of the solution
found with a ``hand-made'' solution of that same instance, that can be found in
the directory \textit{outputs/hand-made/}. If the solution is as good as the
hand-made then it will output a message similar to the one in figure
\ref{fig:benchmark-verbose:optimal}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
{\scriptsize
\begin{BVerbatim}
UPDATE
\end{BVerbatim}
}
\centeredcaption{Example of the output of the benchmark script for the
Constraint Programming solver when the solution found is optimal.}
\label{fig:benchmark-verbose:optimal}
\end{figure}

The format of the information shown in figure \ref{fig:benchmark-verbose:optimal}
is as follows: it tells whether the optimal solution was reached or not (assuming
that the corresponding output in the \textit{outputs/hand-made/} directory is indeed
optimal), the time needed to reach that solution, and finally the progress of the
script. In a Pentium IV CPU, 1.8 GHz, with a single core, it took around 23 minutes
to solve a total of 105 inputs, 85 of them optimally and 15 of them suboptimally.
The inputs used to get the message in figure \ref{fig:benchmark-verbose:optimal} were
all the inputs sorted lexicographically from the ``bwp\_3\_3\_1.in'' to the
``bwp\_11\_10\_1.in''. The total output for the same CPU can be found
in the file ``scripts/CP-p4-benchmark-log''\footnote{ In a Unix-like environment use
the command \textit{less -r} to visualise the contents with colour.}.
An example of the message output by the script when the solution is not optimal is
shown in figure \ref{fig:benchmark-verbose:suboptimal}.

{\scriptsize
\begin{BVerbatim}

}
\centeredcaption{Example of the output of the benchmark script for the

\label{fig:benchmark-verbose:suboptimal}
\end{figure}

One can design their own inputs and allow the benchmark script to compare
the solution found by any solver to the optimal solution found by hand by
making a file containing the output following the format specified in the
report. Also, one could use the Box Wrapper user interface used to make the
optimal outputs for all the inputs in directory \textit{inputs/material/}
(see section \ref{sec:box-wrapper-gui}).

\subsection{Constraint Programming}
\label{sec:benchmarking:constraint-programming}

The parameters used to execute the Constraint Programming solver described in section
\ref{sec:constraint-programming} are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the mixed heuristic (described in section \ref{sec:constraint-programming:optimum:heuristics}).
	\item The solver will stop as soon as it finds a solution or 5 seconds of its execution.
	\item The solver will be executed on randomly permuted data $5$ times (needless to
	say that the data will also be permuted $5$ times).
	\item The solver will use as many available threads as there are in the system.
\end{itemize}

With these parameters, the solver has a ``natural'' timeout of \textbf{45} seconds.
That is, each execution of the solver with the data sorted increasingly by area, by
width, decreasingly sorted by area, by width, and each of the 5 random permutations
have a time limit of 5 seconds. With a total of 9 executions that makes
$5 \text{ seconds/execution} \times 9 \text{ executions} = 45 \text{ seconds}$ of time limit.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:benchmarking:constraint-programming:results}

Needless to say that depending on the machine this software is executed on,
in spite of having the same time limits, a more powerful computer is more likely
to find better solutions since it can explore the search tree more exhaustively
in the same amount of time. Indeed, this is confirmed in table \ref{table:CP-results}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{rcc}
								& Pentium IV 1.8 GHz	& i7-6700 HQ 3.5 GHz (x8) \\
		\midrule
		Optimal solutions		& 93 / 108				& x / 108 \\
		Sub-optimal solutions	& 15 / 108				& x / 108 \\
		Unsolved instances		&  0 / 108				& x / 108 \\
		Total time				& 37 mins				& x mins \\
	\end{tabular}
	\centeredcaption{Summary presenting the amount of optimally and suboptimally solved
	instances, and unsolved instances over all 108 instances in the \textit{inputs/material/}
	directory. Also, the total execution is given for the CP solver in two different CPUs.}
	\label{table:CP-results}
\end{table}

The outputs can be found in the \textit{outputs/} directory, inside folders
\textit{CP-p4/} and \textit{CP-i7/} respectively. Table \ref{table:CP-results:suboptimalinstances}
gives the list of instances solved suboptimally for each CPU.

	\label{table:CP-results:suboptimalinstances}
\end{table}

\subsection{Linear Programming}
\label{sec:benchmarking:linear-programming}

The parameters used to execute the Linear Programming solver are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The solver will stop as soon as it finds the optimal solution or not much
	later than \textbf{45} seconds have passed since the start of its execution.
	\item The solver will use as many available threads as there are in the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:benchmarking:linear-programming:results}

The CPLEX library was obtained through an academical-use only license for a 64-bit system.
For this reason, we can only present results for one CPU only. See table \ref{table:LP-results}
for a summary on the amount of optimally and suboptimally solved instances with the i7-6700 HQ 3.5 GHz
CPU.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{rcc}
								& i7-6700 HQ 3.5 GHz (x8) \\
		\midrule
		Optimal solutions		& x / 108 \\
		Sub-optimal solutions	& x / 108 \\
		Unsolved instances		& x / 108 \\
		Total time				& x mins \\
	\end{tabular}
	\centeredcaption{Summary presenting the amount of optimally and suboptimally solved
	instances, and unsolved instances. Also, the total execution is given for the LP solver.}
	\label{table:LP-results}
\end{table}

The outputs can be found in the \textit{outputs/} directory, inside folder
\textit{LP-i7/}. Table \ref{table:LP-results:suboptimalinstances}
gives the list of unsolved instances and instances solved suboptimally.
